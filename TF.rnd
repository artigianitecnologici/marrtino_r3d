static_transform_publisher x y z yaw pitch roll frame_id child_frame_id period_in_ms

    Publish a static coordinate transform to tf using an x/y/z offset in meters and yaw/pitch/roll in radians. (yaw is rotation about Z, pitch is rotation about Y, and roll is rotation about X). The period, in milliseconds, specifies how often to send a transform. 100ms (10hz) is a good value.
